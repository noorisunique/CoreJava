Benefits of Encapsulation
1.The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
2.A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.
3.Encapsulation helps us in binding the data(instance variables) and the 
	member functions(that work on the instance variables) of a class.
4.Encapsulation is also useful in hiding the data(instance variables) of a class from an illegal direct access.
5.Encapsulation also helps us to make a flexible code which is easy to change and maintain.
6.security, flexibility and its easy maintainability through encapsulation.
7.Data Hiding , Flexibility ,Reusability ,Testing of the code

Benefits of Abstraction
1.It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.
2.Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
3.Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

Diff Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detail hiding(implementation hiding).
