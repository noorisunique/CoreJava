Semaphore- it an abstraction that allows n units to be acquired, and offers acquire and release mechanisms. It safely 
			allows us to ensure that only n processes can access a certain resource at a given time.

A java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch is a concurrency construct that allows one or more 
	threads to wait for a given set of operations to complete.
