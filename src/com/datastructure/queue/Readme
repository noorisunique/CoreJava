what is diff unbounded and bounded queue in java
Bounded Queues are queues which are bounded by capacity that means we need to provide the max size of the queue at the time of creation.
For example ArrayBlockingQueue (see previous example). 
Unbounded Queues are queues which are NOT bounded by capacity that means we should not provide the size of the queue.

ArrayBlockingQueue-Bounded 
ConcurrentLinkedQueue-unbounded queue
