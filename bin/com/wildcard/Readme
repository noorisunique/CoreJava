Java Generics Bounded Type Parameters
Suppose we want to restrict the type of objects that can be used in the parameterized type, 
for example in a method that compares two objects and we want to make sure that the accepted 
objects are Comparables. To declare a bounded type parameter, list the type parameter’s name, 
followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound, similar like below method.


public static <T extends Comparable<T>> int compare(T t1, T t2){
		return t1.compareTo(t2);
	}
