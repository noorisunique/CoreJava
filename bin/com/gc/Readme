There are generally four different ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection.
1.Nullifying the reference variable
2.Re-assigning the reference variable
3.Object created inside method
4.Island of Isolation

How can an object be unreferenced?
There are many ways:

By nulling the reference
By assigning a reference to another
By anonymous object etc.

1) By nulling a reference:
Employee e=new Employee();  
e=null;  

2) By assigning a reference to another:
Employee e1=new Employee();  
Employee e2=new Employee();  
e1=e2;//now the first object referred by e1 is available for garbage collection  
3) By anonymous object:
new Employee();
